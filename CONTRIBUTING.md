Contributing to blogx
---------------------

The `blogx` project welcomes all contributors, whether it be for code,
documentation, infrastructure, or anything else that may be needed.

When contributing to `blogx`, developers should make pull requests
toward the `master` branch. If your implementation is complex, we
expect a detailed explanation of what's happening.

In addition to the pull request requirement, contributors should
also keep in line with the following style guide:

- No more than **79 characters per line**
- **Four-space indents**
- ***ProperCase* for class names**, ***CAPITALIZED* for constants**,
  and ***snake_case* for others**
- Source code **must pass `flake8` linting**

Furthermore, for pull requests to be considered for merge, they must
satisfy 100% coverage through running tests. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)
for more details on collecting coverage.
